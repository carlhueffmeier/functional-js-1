# Functional JavaScript

This repository was used for a talk on functional programming in August 2018, but it contains enough comments to be useful on its own.

The premise is, that we refactor a simple script from procedural code to increasingly more functional code.

Pull requests for clarification are most welcome!

## Getting started

1.  Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2.  Execute each file from within the project folder

```
node episode-01.js
```
